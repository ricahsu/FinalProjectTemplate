# Meeting Template

Go through this template in preparation for your meeting with the course staff member. We are not grading you on this template, just will help with questions and discussion. Please note, staff have the right to ask you to schedule a second meeting. The goal is to help you flesh out a reasonable project for this course, so make sure to use these meetings as a resource!

## Project Ideas
What are some ideas for your project? Why does that interest you?

My ideas are dog park platdates. The dog owners can input the distance they can accept of the parks and it will show the option of the parks and its features and maybe reviews. Also, for each park, there maybe some dogs visit there regularly at certain date and time. So the dog owner can setup a playdate with the other owner. Afterwards, the owener can write a review about the park and leave the comments about the other dog. 

I was wondering if there are dogs at park, so my dog can have platmates to play with, to run around the park. That's why I came up the ideas of nearby parks and also if the playdate partners are friendly or not. 


## What are the big ideas?
How does this address some of the big learning ideas of 5001?

## Code Design Thoughts
Are you including classes or APIs, what about dictionaries? One of the worst things you can do is go into a project assuming you are going to 'hard' code everything (this happens often with text based games, then students get stuck). You don't have to know details yet, but you should think about separation of concerns, and how to divide up your code. 
    
    Dictionaries for park and its features, such as a pool or tunnels.  

    Classes for dogs that visit regulary at certain date and time. I would include attributes as names, dates, time and its characters. 

    Store the reviews for the parks and retrieve the data when clients would like to read them, also they can leave the reviews for the park with ratings. 

    Using command line interface for client to interact with this programm. 
    


## Resources Found
What are some resources you have found already or already have access to? (APIs, libraries, past assignments, etc)

## Timeline
Setup a general timeline that includes research and development, and when you want to have certain aspects of the project done.
